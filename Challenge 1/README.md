# Blinkit SDE Intern Challenge
We were asked to build a simple app to upload images with authentication, I went a step ahead and made it into a complete lost and found management system.
IMPORTANT NOTE: I have voluntarily not removed the .env file for easy access to the project, as the database does not contain any sensitive information.

## Instructions

### Client Setup
1. Navigate to the client folder.
2. Run the following command to install all dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the client by running:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
   This will open the browser automatically.

### Server Setup
1. Minimize the browser.
2. Go to the server folder.
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the server:
    ```
    node server.js
    ```

## Additional Information
- The client folder contains the frontend application.
- The server folder contains the backend server.
- Ensure both the client and server are running simultaneously for the application to function properly.
